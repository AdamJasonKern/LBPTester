 "# Welcome to the Linear Algebra Game!\n\nThis game works as a learning tool for linear algebra,\nbased on the textbook \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" by Sheldon Axler. It also serves as an\nintroduction to Lean 4, a proof assistant that provides an environment to encode proofs formally.\n\nProofs in Lean can are written in precise syntax, using tactics and theorems, and can be algorithmically\nchecked for correctness by a computer.\n\nThis game covers many areas of linear algebra, including vector spaces, linear independence, bases,\nlinear mappings, and isomorphisms.\n\nTo start, click on \"Tutorial World\"",
