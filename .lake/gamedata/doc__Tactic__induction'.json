 "## Summary\n\nIf `n : â„•` is an object, and the goal mentions `n`, then `induction' n with d hd`\nattempts to prove the goal by induction on `n`, with the inductive\nvariable in the successor case being `d`, and the inductive hypothesis being `hd`.\n\n### Example:\nIf the goal is\n```\n0 + n = n\n```\n\nthen\n\n`induction' n with d hd`\n\nwill turn it into two goals. The first is `0 + 0 = 0`;\nthe second has an assumption `hd : 0 + d = d` and goal\n`0 + succ d = succ d`.\n\nNote that you must prove the first\ngoal before you can access the second one.",
