 "A subspace is a subset of a vector space that acts similarly to a vector space itself. It has three\nmain properties:\n- Nonempty: a subspace cannot be empty\n- Closure under addition: adding any two elements of a subspace should remain in that subspace\n- Closure under scalar multiplication: scaling any vector in a subspace should remanin in that subspace\n\nSubspaces are formalized by having the `isSubspace` proposition, which simply combines the three\nproperties into one proposition.",
