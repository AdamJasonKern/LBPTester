 "## Summary\n\nIf we have some object or function with some definition, `unfold object` will rewrite the object\nwith its definition everywhere. Lean often unfolds terms automatically, but some tactics and definitions\nare not unfolded automatically. The `unfold` tactic also helps make it easier to take the next steps.\n\n## Example:\n\nIf you have a goal `(P → Q) → (¬ Q → ¬ P)`, with `¬ P` (\\\"Not\\\" P) being defined as `P → False`,\nusing `unfold Not` will change the goal to `(P → Q) → ((Q → False) → (P → False))`",
