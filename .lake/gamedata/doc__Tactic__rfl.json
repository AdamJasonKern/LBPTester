 "## Summary\n\n`rfl` proves goals of the form `X = X`.\n\nIn other words, the `rfl` tactic will close any goal of the\nform `A = B` if `A` and `B` are *identical*.\n\n`rfl` is short for \\\"reflexivity (of equality)\\\".\n\n## Example:\n\nIf the goal looks like this:\n\n```\nx + 37 = x + 37\n```\n\nthen `rfl` will close it. But if it looks like `0 + x = x` then `rfl` won't work, because even\nthough $0+x$ and $x$ are always equal as *numbers*, they are not equal as *terms*.\nThe only term which is identical to `0 + x` is `0 + x`.\n\n## Details\n\n`rfl` is short for \\\"reflexivity of equality\\\".",
