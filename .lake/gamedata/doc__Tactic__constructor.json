This is helpful for goals that are\ndifficult to solve all at once, like \"and\" (`∧`) and \"if and only if\" (`↔`).\n\n## Example\n\nIf we have the goal `P ∧ Q`, `constructor` will change the goal into two goals: `P` and `Q`.\n\n## Example\n\nIf we have the goal`P ↔ Q`, `constructor` will change the goal into two goals: `P → Q`, and `Q → P`.",
