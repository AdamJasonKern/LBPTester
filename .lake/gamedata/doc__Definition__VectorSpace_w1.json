 "A vector space is a space over a field K with an abelian group V. It has four main properties:\n- Distributivity over vector addition,\n- Distributivity over scalar addition,\n- Associativity of scalar multiplication,\n- Identity scalar acting as identity.\n\nThese properties can be found in the theorems tab as \"smul_add\", \"add_smul\", \"mul_smul\", and \"one_smul\".",
